for above cells in same column, maintain the queens added at the column as index.

For left diagonal, you can see that difference of i,j is  constant so maintain that in array d1.

For N=5, i,j will have max value as +4 and min value as -4, so have an array from -4 to 4 but array cannot have -ve index so have an array of size 2N-1 by shifting right.

Now to store, we need to store : i-j+(n-1)
d1[i-j+n-1] = true

For right diagonal : maintain array as i+j will be constant for diagonal
d2[i+j] = true
