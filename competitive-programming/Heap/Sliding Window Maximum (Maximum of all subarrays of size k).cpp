Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6}, K = 3 
Output: 3 3 4 5 5 5 6
Explanation: 
Maximum of 1, 2, 3 is 3
Maximum of 2, 3, 1 is 3
Maximum of 3, 1, 4 is 4
Maximum of 1, 4, 5 is 5
Maximum of 4, 5, 2 is 5 
Maximum of 5, 2, 3 is 5
Maximum of 2, 3, 6 is 6

Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13}, K = 4 
Output: 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
Explanation:
Maximum of first 4 elements is 10, similarly for next 4 
elements (i.e from index 1 to 4) is 10, So the sequence 
generated is 10 10 10 15 15 90 90


Method 1: This is a simple method to solve the above problem.



Approach: 
The idea is very basic run a nested loop, 
the outer loop which will mark the starting point of the subarray of length k, 
the inner loop will run from the starting index to index+k, 
k elements from starting index and print the maximum element among these k elements. 

Algorithm: 

Create a nested loop, the outer loop from starting index to n â€“ k th elements. 
The inner loop will run for k iterations.
Create a variable to store the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
Find the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
Print the maximum element in every iteration of outer loop
Implementation:

// C++ Program to find the maximum for
// each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Method to find the maximum for each
// and every contiguous subarray of size k.
void printKMax(int arr[], int n, int k)
{
    int j, max;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++)
    {
        max = arr[i];

        for (j = 1; j < k; j++)
        {
            if (arr[i + j] > max)
                max = arr[i + j];
        }
        cout << max << " ";
    }
}

{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int k = 3;
    printKMax(arr, n, k);
    return 0;
}

Output

Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(N * K). 
The outer loop runs n-k+1 times and the inner loop runs k times for every iteration of outer loop. 
So time complexity is O((n-k+1)*k) which can also be written as O(N * K).
Space Complexity: O(1). 
No extra space is required.
Method 2: This method uses the Self-Balancing BST to solve the given problem.

Approach: 
To find maximum among k elements of the subarray the previous method uses a loop traversing through the elements. 
To reduce that time the idea is to use an AVL tree which returns the maximum element in log n time. 
So, traverse through the array and keep k elements in the BST and print the maximum in every iteration. 
AVL tree is a suitable data structure as lookup, insertion, 
and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, 
where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. 

Algorithm: 



Create a Self-balancing BST (AVL tree) to store and find the maximum element.
Traverse through the array from start to end.
Insert the element in the AVL tree.
If the loop counter is greater than or equal to k then delete i-k th element from the BST
Print the maximum element of the BST.

Complexity Analysis:  

Time Complexity: O(N * Log k). 
Insertion, deletion and search takes log k time in a AVL tree. So the overall time Complexity is O(N * log k)
Space Complexity: O(k). 
The space required to store k elements in a BST is O(k).
Method 3: This method uses Deque to solve the above problem

Approach: 
Create a Deque, Qi of capacity k, 
that stores only useful elements of current window of k elements. 
An element is useful if it is in current window and 
is greater than all other elements on right side of it in current window. 
Process all array elements one by one and maintain Qi 
to contain useful elements of current window and these useful elements are maintained in sorted order. 
The element at front of the Qi is the largest and element at rear/back of Qi is the smallest of current window. 
Thanks to Aashish for suggesting this method.

Dry run of the above approach: 



Algorithm:  

Create a deque to store k elements.
Run a loop and insert first k elements in the deque. Before inserting the element, 
check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, 
if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, 
until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. 
Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
Now, run a loop from k to end of the array.
Print the front element of the deque.
Remove the element from the front of the queue if they are out of the current window.
Insert the next element in the deque. Before inserting the element, 
check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, 
if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, 
until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. 
Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
Print the maximum element of the last window.

Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(n). 
It seems more than O(n) at first look. 
It can be observed that every element of array is added and removed at most once. 
So there are total 2n operations.
Auxiliary Space: O(k). 
Elements stored in the dequeue take O(k) space.
Below is an extension of this problem: 
Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k.

Method 4: This method is modification in queue implementation of two stack:

Algorithm :

While pushing the element, we constantly push in stack 2. 
The maximum of stack 2 will always be the maximum of the top element of stack 2.
While popping, we will always pop from stack 1, 
and if stack 1 is empty then we shall push every element of stack 2 to stack 1 and updating the maximum
The above two-step are followed in queue implementation of stack
Now to find the maximum of the whole queue (Same as both stack), 
we will take the top element of both stack maximum; hence this is the maximum of the whole queue.
Now, this technique can be used to slide window and get maximum.
while sliding window by 1 index delete the last one, insert the new one and then take a maximum of both stack

Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(N): This is because every element will just two types push and pop; hence time complexity is linear.
Space Complexity: O(K): This is because at any moment, 
the sum of stack size of both stacks will exactly equal to K, 
As every time we pop exactly one element and push exactly One.
Method 5: This method uses Max-Heap to solve the above problem.

Approach: 
In the above-mentioned methods, one of them was using AVL tree. 
This approach is very similar to that approach. 
The difference is that instead of using the AVL tree, 
Max-Heap will be used in this approach. 
The elements of the current window will be stored in the Max-Heap 
and the maximum element or the root will be printed in each iteration. 
Max-heap is a suitable data structure as it provides constant-time retrieval 
and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum elements in it, i.e. 
it takes constant time to find the maximum element, and insertion and deletion takes log n time.  

Algorithm:

Pick first k elements and create a max heap of size k.
Perform heapify and print the root element.
Store the next and last element from the array
Run a loop from k â€“ 1 to n 
Replace the value of element which is got out of the window with new element which came inside the window.
Perform heapify.
Print the root of the Heap.
