Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6}, K = 3 
Output: 3 3 4 5 5 5 6
Explanation: 
Maximum of 1, 2, 3 is 3
Maximum of 2, 3, 1 is 3
Maximum of 3, 1, 4 is 4
Maximum of 1, 4, 5 is 5
Maximum of 4, 5, 2 is 5 
Maximum of 5, 2, 3 is 5
Maximum of 2, 3, 6 is 6

Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13}, K = 4 
Output: 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
Explanation:
Maximum of first 4 elements is 10, similarly for next 4 
elements (i.e from index 1 to 4) is 10, So the sequence 
generated is 10 10 10 15 15 90 90


Method 1: This is a simple method to solve the above problem.



Approach: 
The idea is very basic run a nested loop, 
the outer loop which will mark the starting point of the subarray of length k, 
the inner loop will run from the starting index to index+k, 
k elements from starting index and print the maximum element among these k elements. 

Algorithm: 

Create a nested loop, the outer loop from starting index to n â€“ k th elements. 
The inner loop will run for k iterations.
Create a variable to store the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
Find the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
Print the maximum element in every iteration of outer loop

            if arr[i + j] > max:
                max = arr[i + j]
        print(str(max) + " ", end="")

    printMax(arr, n, k)

Output
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(N * K). 
The outer loop runs n-k+1 times and the inner loop runs k times for every iteration of outer loop. 
So time complexity is O((n-k+1)*k) which can also be written as O(N * K).
Space Complexity: O(1). 
No extra space is required.
Method 2: This method uses the Self-Balancing BST to solve the given problem.

Approach: 
To find maximum among k elements of the subarray the previous method uses a loop traversing through the elements. 
To reduce that time the idea is to use an AVL tree which returns the maximum element in log n time. 
So, traverse through the array and keep k elements in the BST and print the maximum in every iteration. 
AVL tree is a suitable data structure as lookup, insertion, 
and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, 
where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. 

Algorithm: 



Create a Self-balancing BST (AVL tree) to store and find the maximum element.
Traverse through the array from start to end.
Insert the element in the AVL tree.
If the loop counter is greater than or equal to k then delete i-k th element from the BST
Print the maximum element of the BST.

Output
10 10 10 15 15 90 90 
Complexity Analysis:  

Time Complexity: O(N * Log k). 
Insertion, deletion and search takes log k time in a AVL tree. So the overall time Complexity is O(N * log k)
Space Complexity: O(k). 
The space required to store k elements in a BST is O(k).
Method 3: This method uses Deque to solve the above problem

Approach: 
Create a Deque, Qi of capacity k, 
that stores only useful elements of current window of k elements. 
An element is useful if it is in current window and 
is greater than all other elements on right side of it in current window. 
Process all array elements one by one and maintain Qi 
to contain useful elements of current window and these useful elements are maintained in sorted order. 
The element at front of the Qi is the largest and element at rear/back of Qi is the smallest of current window. 
Thanks to Aashish for suggesting this method.

Dry run of the above approach: 



Algorithm:  

Create a deque to store k elements.
Run a loop and insert first k elements in the deque. Before inserting the element, 
check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, 
if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, 
until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. 
Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
Now, run a loop from k to end of the array.
Print the front element of the deque.
Remove the element from the front of the queue if they are out of the current window.
Insert the next element in the deque. Before inserting the element, 
check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, 
if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, 
until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. 
Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
Print the maximum element of the last window.
