Given a Graph, count number of triangles in it. The graph is can be directed or undirected.

Example: 
Input: digraph[V][V] = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
                        {1, 0, 0, 1},
                        {0, 1, 0, 0},
                        {0, 0, 1, 0}
                      };
Output: 2
Give adjacency matrix represents following 
directed graph.

We have discussed a method based on graph trace that works for undirected graphs. In this post a new method is discussed with that is simpler and works for both directed and undirected graphs.
The idea is to use three nested loops to consider every triplet (i, j, k) and check for the above condition (there is an edge from i to j, j to k and k to i) 
However in an undirected graph, the triplet (i, j, k) can be permuted to give six combination (See previous post for details). Hence we divide the total count by 6 to get the actual number of triangles. 
In case of directed graph, the number of permutation would be 3 (as order of nodes becomes relevant). Hence in this case the total number of triangles will be obtained by dividing total count by 3. For example consider the directed graph given below 

Following is the implementation.
Output
The Number of triangles in undirected graph : 2

The Number of triangles in directed graph : 2
Comparison of this approach with previous approach: 
Advantages: 

No need to calculate Trace.
Matrix- multiplication is not required.
Auxiliary matrices are not required hence optimized in space.
Works for directed graphs.
Disadvantages: 

The time complexity is O(n3) and canâ€™t be reduced any further.
