Longest Repeating Subsequence 
Easy Accuracy: 50.4% Submissions: 31783 Points: 2
Given a string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string. The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B.

Example 1:

Input:
str = "axxxy"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The given array with indexes looks like
a x x x y 
0 1 2 3 4

The longest subsequence is "xx". 
It appears twice as explained below.

subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of str 


subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 3  <-- index of str 

We are able to use character 'x' 
(at index 2 in str) in both subsequences
as it appears on index 1 in subsequence A 
and index 0 in subsequence B.
Example 2:

Input:
str = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The longest reapting subsequenece is "a".

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the LongestRepeatingSubsequence() which takes str as input parameter and returns the length of the longest repeating subsequnece.
