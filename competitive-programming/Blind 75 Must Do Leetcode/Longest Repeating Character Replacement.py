You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length'''

# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)

# Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters,
# you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times.
# Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters
# you can get after performing the above operations.
#
# Note:
# Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# s = "ABAB", k = 2
#
# Output:
# 4
#
# Explanation:
# Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# s = "AABABBA", k = 1
#
# Output:
# 4
#
# Explanation:
# Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
