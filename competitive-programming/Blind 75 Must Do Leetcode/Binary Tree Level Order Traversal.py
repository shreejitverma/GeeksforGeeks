Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000'''

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans, level = [], [root]
        while root and level:
            ans.append([node.val for node in level])
            LRpair = [(node.left, node.right) for node in level]
            level = [leaf for LR in LRpair for leaf in LR if leaf]
        return ans
